## PURPOSE

## 1. OVERVIEW

Twenty thousand dogs are euthanized a year in the UK,  the majority of these dogs are unwanted pets that have ended up in a dog sanctuary,  Due to this complete waste of animal life, I decided 
to create https://adoptdog.com.  This site will try to address this problem by having the functionality to show pictures of dogs that are in sanctuaries.  So I can give details of where they are 
being kept,  at first for the Berkshire area.  This site will give the ability for a user to see a picture of a dog and add a commment , find contact details, and leave a message for the administrators of 
this site.

I hope to actively help in finding these dogs through no fault of their own from being destroyed and finding them new homes where they can become part of a new family.
