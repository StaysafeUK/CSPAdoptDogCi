## 1. OVERVIEW

Twenty thousand dogs are euthanized a year in the UK,  the majority of these dogs are unwanted pets that have ended up in a dog sanctuary,  Due to this complete waste of animal life, I decided to create https://www.adoptdog.com.  This site will try to address this problem by having the functionality to show pictures of dogs that are in sanctuaries.  So I can give details of where they are being kept,  at first for the Berkshire area, and if the site goes viral throughout the UK.  This site will give the ability for a user to see a picture of a dog and add a comment , find contact details, search for a sanctuary and navigate through to a dog that is housed there, and leave a message for the administrators of this site.

This site will for the duration of the project hold fictitious sanctuaries and dogs until the project is marked,  potentially after the marking the site can be populated with real data.

I hope to actively help in finding dogs new homes where they can become part of a new family.  As through no fault of their own, if they do not gain new owners the dogs will be destroyed.
