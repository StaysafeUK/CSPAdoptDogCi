## 1. OVERVIEW

Twenty thousand dogs are euthanized a year in the UK,  the majority of these dogs are unwanted pets that have ended up in a dog sanctuary,  Due to this complete waste of animal life, I decided 
to create https://adoptdog.com.  This site will try to address this problem by having the functionality to show pictures of dogs that are in sanctuaries.  So I can give details of where they are 
being kept,  at first for the Berkshire area.  This site will give the ability for a user to see a picture of a dog and add a commment , find contact details, and leave a message for the administrators of 
this site.

This site will for the duration of the project hold fictitious sanctuaries and dogs until the project is marked,  potentially after the marking the site can be populated with real data.

I hope to actively help in finding these dogs through no fault of their own from being destroyed and finding them new homes where they can become part of a new family.
